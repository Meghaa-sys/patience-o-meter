### Project Description
Welcome to Patience-O-Meter ‚Äî the Ultimate Test of Your Sanity

Think you‚Äôre calm? Unshakable? The zen master of the internet?
Let‚Äôs see about that.

It all starts simple ‚Äî just type your credentials. Oh wait‚Ä¶ why is it typing backwards?
Don‚Äôt worry, the ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù button will save you‚Ä¶ if you can catch it. It flies, it dodges, it mocks you.

Survive that and you‚Äôre rewarded with Game Mania ‚Äî a carnival of games where every one is designed to make you lose. Every click, every move, every false glimmer of hope is part of the trap. Victory? Not on this site.

Finally, when your blood pressure has politely knocked on the stratosphere, we give you the Rage Scale ‚Äî a place to measure just how much this site broke you.

Patience-O-Meter isn‚Äôt just a website.
It‚Äôs an experience.
It‚Äôs a chaotic, trolling, sanity-shattering rage inducer you‚Äôll love to hate.

Come for the challenge. Stay because the button won‚Äôt let you leave.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, people are losing their ability to truly appreciate frustration. We breeze through logins, click buttons instantly, and win games too easily. Without proper training, our tolerance for life‚Äôs little annoyances is plummeting ‚Äî leading to an alarming Global Patience Deficiency.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Alleged Solution ‚Äî Patience-O-Meter:
Patience-O-Meter is a revolutionary platform that reintroduces healthy irritation into your daily routine. By reversing your typed input, making the submit button physically avoid your cursor, mocking your every attempt, and offering a suite of unwinnable games, we help ‚Äústrengthen‚Äù your patience muscles.

Finally, our Rage Scale provides a scientifically meaningless measure of your emotional state, letting you track your journey from ‚Äúslightly annoyed‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm uninstalling the internet.‚Äù

With Patience-O-Meter, we are restoring the lost art of waiting and raging ‚Äî one impossible click at a time.
